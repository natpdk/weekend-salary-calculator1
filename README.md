## My To Do List:
    -Submit Button:
        -DONE: Inputs a new row in a table for employee information
            -Each row needs to have their First Name, Last Name, ID Number, Job Title, and Annual Salary
        -NOT STARTED: The footer needs to display a sum of the total monthly costs (so the each annual salary needs to be divided by 12 and then added together in the footer??)
        -NOT WORKING: The form inputs need to clear out after the button is hit.

    -NOT STARTED: If the total monthly costs exceed $20,000, and over-budget CSS class needs to be applied to the footer.

    -DONE: I need to put in a table styling so that the information goes into a table.

    -ALMOST DONE: Create a 'Delete' button to remove an employee from the DOM *** Don't worry about the monthly cost going down with that right now ***

    -DONE: I need a JS file and a  CSS file


## Problems I'm having:
    -How do I get the input boxes to clear back to their placeholder names after I hit submit?
    -Getting the monthly cost to add up.
        -Also getting the monthly cost to show up in the footer.
